# 18F Tech Talk: The Greatest Git Flag (-p)

This was a talk, given 2015/05/18, about the various uses and surprising
utility of the git flag `-p`, and how it can be used when applied to several
different git commands.

The gist is that `-p` reveals diffs/patches everywhere, and for some commands,
even starts up an interactive mode where the developer can add, remove, or edit
their diffs bit-by-bit. By doing so, a developer can very easily break up
large swaths of mixed-up work into small, focused commits.
