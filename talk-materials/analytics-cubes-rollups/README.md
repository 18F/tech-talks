# Analytics: Cubes and Rollups

Tech Talk by Catherine Devlin, 9 Jan 2017

Examples of using new PostgreSQL 9.5 analytics features:
`CUBE`, `ROLLUP`, and `GROUPING`.  These can be useful for
pre-calculating aggregate results over many dimensions.

The [notebook](analytics_cubes_and_rollups.ipynb) can be viewed directly in Github, 
or the notebook can be run live locally after installing 
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).  See 
[Becky's tech talk](../jupyter-notebook/README.md) for more about 
Jupyter Notebooks.
