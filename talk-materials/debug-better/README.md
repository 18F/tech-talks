# Debug Better

This was a language-independent talk about how to spend less of your
time debugging instead of programming. I described it as **"a whole load
of seemingly-obvious tips which all beginners would be much better off knowing
yet even experienced engineers usually miss"**.

## Slides

The Keynote file is far too large to stick in a git repo, so instead
here's a link to [the slides on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/yozlet/programming-is-debugging-so-debug-better).

## Video

I gave a version of this talk at Open Source Bridge in 2013. [Here's the video. (45min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hoL3WmgUI8)

## Code (Panorama)

In the talk I demoed an in-progress project of mine called [Panorama](https://github.com/yozlet/panorama/) - it's a new approach to graphical debuggers, built in/for Ruby. Panorama is still very rough and barely works for anything other than simple demos, but maybe one day... with a little help...?
