# Tech Talks

In 2015, 18F started running a series of tech talks: short, internal talks where we share our favorite technology and project information with one another.

After a break, Tech Talks are returning!

This repository is a place to store the related materials, so they:
* aren't lost to the sands of time or Slack, and
* can be useful to others.

## Upcoming Tech Talks

**December 14, 2021**

Building & Analyzing Network Data with Aspen (Matt Cloyd)

>We don’t see graph databases often at 18F, but networks and graph data are useful in many domains, including consulting.
>
>In this tech talk, we’ll start with graph data basics. Then we’ll use Aspen—a Markdown-like language for graphs—to build and analyze a social graph based on a real-world consulting project.


For past talks, check out our [Archive](archive.md).


## How to attend

If you're an 18F or TTS staffer and would like to attend the talks, ask in #tech-talks or #dev on Slack to be added to the invite (or find it on the "TTS Guild Meetings & Office Hours" calendar).

## How to suggest a talk

If you're a staff member who would like to give a talk, please contact us in #tech-talks on Slack or add an issue: https://github.com/18F/tech-talks/issues . You can present either a shorter lightning talk (5-10 minutes) to full length talk (30-40 minutes).

What can you talk about? Anything technical! This can be related to work at 18F/TTS or technical things you have done outside of work. You don't have to be an engineer either! If you have a technical talk idea, let us know!

## How to use this repo

If you're a staff member who is giving a tech talk, please create a talk-specific folder and put your materials there. Whatever you have—code samples, links, slides, video—we'll take it!

If you're not a TTS staffer but want to see what people are talking about, poke around. These are quick, introductory talks; thus there may not be extensive documentation, but there might be something to pique your interest.
