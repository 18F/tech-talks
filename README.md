# 18F Tech Talks

18F has a running series of tech talks: short, internal talks where we share our favorite technology and project information with one another.

This repository is a place to store the related materials, so they:
* aren't lost to the sands of time or Slack, and
* can be useful to others.

## How to use

If you're an 18F staffer and would like to attend the talks, ask in #dev to be added to the invite.

If you're an 18F staffer who is giving a tech talk, please create a talk-specific folder and put your materials there. Whatever you have--code samples, links, slides, video--we'll take it!

If you're an 18F staffer who would like to give a talk, [add yourself to the queue](https://github.com/18F/tech-talks/edit/master/Queue.md).

If you're not an 18F staffer but want to see what people are talking about, poke around. These are quick, introductory talks; thus there may not be extensive documentation, but there might be something to pique your interest.
