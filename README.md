# Tech Talks

Since 2015, 18F has hosted a series of tech talks - short, internal talks where we share our favorite technology and project information with one another.

This repository is a place to store the related materials, so they:
* aren't lost to the sands of time or Slack, and
* can be useful to others.

## Upcoming Tech Talks

**February 15, 2022**

*A Primer on Functional Programming* (Sarah Withee)

>Functional programming languages are gaining in popularity. If you’ve worked in object-oriented languages, you might be baffled at how they work. Maybe hearing the word “recursion” makes you want to scream. Or maybe you’ve just heard the hype and want to know what the hype is about.

>In this talk, we will briefly explain what functional languages are, and go into some examples of tasks that these languages are suited for. We will look at the major languages in use today and see how they work. We’ll see some of the things they have in common, and the many things that make them distinctive. Finally, we’ll offer some suggestions on how to dive into learning these and using them on your own projects.

For past talks, check out our [Archive](archive.md).

## How to attend

If you're an 18F or TTS staffer and would like to attend the talks, ask in #tech-talks or #dev on Slack to be added to the invite (or find it on the "TTS Guild Meetings & Office Hours" calendar).

## How to suggest a talk

If you're a staff member who would like to give a talk, please contact us in #tech-talks on Slack or add an issue: https://github.com/18F/tech-talks/issues

You can present shorter lightning talks (5-10 minutes) which we'll combine with other short talks for a Tech Talks Lite session, or longer talks in which you'd be the featured speaker of the month (30-40 minutes).

What can you talk about? Anything technical! This can be related to work at 18F/TTS, or it could be about a broader technical topic (side projects, conference recaps, Computer Science concepts - the list goes on!). You don't have to be a "coder" either! If you have a technical talk idea, let us know!

## How to use this repo

If you're a staff member who is giving a tech talk, please create a talk-specific folder and put your materials there. Whatever you have—code samples, links, slides, video—we'll take it!

If you're not a TTS staffer but want to see what people are talking about, poke around. These are quick, introductory talks; thus there may not be extensive documentation, but there might be something to pique your interest.
