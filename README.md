# Tech Talks

Since 2015, 18F has hosted a series of tech talks - short, internal talks where we share our favorite technology and project information with one another. After a short break in 2021, we're back and now TTS-wide!

This repository is a place to store the related materials, so they:
* aren't lost to the sands of time or Slack, and
* can be useful to others.

The current lead is [Julia Allen](https://github.com/julialeague).

Find us on the GSA TTS Slack in the [#tech-talks](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=tech-talks)ðŸ”’ channel.

## Upcoming Tech Talks

We're scheduling our next talks soon. Stay tuned!

For past talks, check out our [Archive](archive.md).

## How to attend

If you're an 18F or TTS staffer and would like to attend the talks, ask in #tech-talks or #dev on Slack to be added to the invite (or find it on the "TTS Guild Meetings & Office Hours" calendar).

## How to suggest a talk

If you're a staff member who would like to give a talk, please contact us in [#tech-talks](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=tech-talks)ðŸ”’ on Slack or add an issue: https://github.com/18F/tech-talks/issues

You can present shorter lightning talks (5-10 minutes) which we'll combine with other short talks for a Tech Talks Lite session, or longer talks in which you'd be the featured speaker of the month (25-30 minutes).

What can you talk about? Anything technical! This can be related to work at TTS, or it could be about a broader technical topic (side projects, conference recaps, computer science concepts - the list goes on!). You don't have to be a "coder" either! If you have a technical talk idea, let us know!

## How to use this repo

If you're a staff member who is giving a tech talk, please create a talk-specific folder and put your materials there. Whatever you haveâ€”code samples, links, slides, videoâ€”we'll take it!

If you're not a TTS staffer but want to see what people are talking about, poke around. These are quick, introductory talks; thus there may not be extensive documentation, but there might be something to pique your interest.

## FAQ

Q. As a presenter, how do I tock this time?

A. Bill it under your project if you have one, or 18F/Non-Billable if you don't. See the [revised Tock guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FG4Gsv-diySrt8fgZxMCRg9mA1SD2RZJRC07ZlDAGAI/edit#heading=h.mh798s6y4h4) as of Jan 20, 2023.
